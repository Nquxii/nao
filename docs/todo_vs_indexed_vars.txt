#### todo vs user defined categories

if you start up nao without any added categories, youll get something like this:
```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO]
```

to add a todo, there is lack of flexibility and you are forced to use commas to index the to-do properly

`-t go for a walk`

```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO] go for a walk
```

`-t visit dad `

```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO] go for a walk, visit dad
```


when you make your own categories, there is no set divisor and you remove your descriptions **by string**

```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO] go for a walk
```

`-c PRGM`

```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO] go for a walk
[PRGM]
```

`-d, 1, Learn Python`

```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO] go for a walk
[PRGM] Learn Python
```

`rd, 1, Python`

```
[TIME] 5:00
[DATE] 01/26/2021
[TODO] go for a walk
[PRGM] Learn
```

#### this should give you some knowledge as to how the category system works, it removes strings, not indexed variables.
